      <p class="one">But the current profusion of communication surfaces has not brought about a more comprehensive understanding and control of power dynamics, nor an increase in real connectivity, rather it seems to have further enhanced the reflecting agency of capital and representation while atomizing individuals.</p>
      <p class="two">The mirror-as-device has fragmented and multiplied, penetrating the most intimate, personal scale and reframing our subjectivity.</p>

      <p class="big">Now,</p>
      <p class="three">it is not only the outside that is reflected but also and foremost our inner landscapes, a shift mirroring capital coming full circle, colonizing our emotion and affect. </p>
      <p class="four">At the same time, the production of images has been outsourced, capital’s iconic figure, the self-made man, has exploded to new heights produced and disseminated via repeated selfies and scrolls by the current citizen-entrepreneur, the 24/7 independent precarious worker. The prosumer now autonomously produces and consumes its own images of entrapment. </p>
      <p class="five">Titled The Sound of Screens Imploding, the current edition of BIM, the Biennale de l’Image en Mouvement, opened in November 2018 and is curated by Andrea Lissoni, senior curator of international art film at Tate Modern, and Andrea Bellini, director of the Centre d’Art Contemporain Geneve.</p>
