      <section id="who">
        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <h4>Sure, cheese is great and all but wait to see what we can offer...</h4>

      <section id="why">
        <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
        <p>Well, there's 3 reasons :</p>
        <ol>
          <li>We care for the environment, and want to help. It's bad (even <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/climate-change/">National Geographic</a> says so.), and if we can make it slightly better we will!</li>
          <li>We want to make sure our customers eat healthy food, from good products and loving preparation.</li>
          <li>And lastly, now that we have a restaurant, our life evolves around food and that's pretty cool...</li>
