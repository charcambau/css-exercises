        <h3><span id="pastille1">01</span>Good design is innovative</h3>

        <h3><span id="pastille2">02</span>Good design makes a product useful</h3>
        <p>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</p>

        <h3><span id="pastille3">03</span>Good design is aesthetic</h3>
        <p>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p>
