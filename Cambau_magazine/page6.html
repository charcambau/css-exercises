      <p class="one">Meriem Bennani’s multichannel Party on the CAPS -2018- imagines a world reconfigured by biotechnology and teleportation. </p>
      <p class="two">Taking place on an isolated island in the Atlantic Ocean, it reflects on the physical and psychological displacement imposed on refugees and immigrants by states worldwide.</p>
      <img src="4.jpg" alt="image of the exhibit" class="img">
      <p class="three">Displacement is also explored by Lawrence Abu Hamdan, whose work draws from the current increase of fortified borders, which has expanded from fifteen in 2000 to today’s sixty-three. Walled Unwalled -2018- connects this context with the concurrent discovery of muons, invisible cosmic particles that pass through surfaces impervious to X-rays, penetrating what were once regarded as established boundaries.</p>

      <p class="four">Abu Hamdan’s ongoing exploration of physical and visual limits also manifested in the biennial’s opening party, which acted as a powerful statement regarding the pervasive contemporary regime of hypervisibility. At the club night hosted by Nkisi, presenting COLD WAR -Nkisi/John T. Gast-, Crystallmess, and the extraordinary Abyss X, the dominance of vision was erased by a darkened, opaque, smoked space punctuated by irregular laser lights and deep sounds.</p>
      <p class="five">The sensorial environment molded the audience into a single body, an anonymous mass whose empathy for one another organically counteracted the isolation key to the age of self-representation, and at the same time implemented a regime of invisibility. The enactment of such a fascinating, visceral kaleidoscope where vision was shaped by the movement of sound and bodies in space demonstrated the possibility of a shared moment of difference and otherness.</p>
      <p class="six">Aptly echoing the antimatter research undertaken nearby at CERN, the event enacted a passage from the reflection of the outside and the monetization of the inside to a shared refraction of the self, together expressing interiority in an environment that forcibly reverberated to the radiant sound of screens imploding.</p>
